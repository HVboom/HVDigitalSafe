## 📖 About

**HVDigitalSafe** is a lightweight, API-only Rails application.  
It securely encrypts and stores text documents of any size in "safe boxes".

Typical use cases include:

- Password storage
- Secure notes
- Any sensitive text information

Documents are stored fully encrypted inside the database and are never accessible in plain text.

HVDigitalSafe is designed to be used together with [**HVKeyGuard**](https://github.com/HVboom/HVKeyGuard#readme), a companion application providing a user interface and authentication workflow.
